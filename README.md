Thebod_Noroute
-

Adds custom 404 pages to Magento.

By default there is a template in app/design/frontend/base/default/norotue/404.ptml which is called by app/design/frontend/base/default/layout/noroute.xml.
Feel free to do what you want with this ;-)

Thebod_Noroute uses the <noroute>-layout handle, feel free to add your own 404 error page using this layout handle.
